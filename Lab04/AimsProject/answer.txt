*Question:
1) Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT(
	-AWT uses Frame as the top-level container.

	-Frame is a heavyweight component (depends on the native OS for rendering).

	-Swing uses JFrame as the top-level container.

	-JFrame is a lightweight component (rendered completely in Java).

	-JFrame allows better portability and consistent appearance across platforms.

	-Swing supports more flexible UI features (e.g., pluggable look and feel).
2) Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing.
	-AWT component classes: Button, Label, TextField, Checkbox, etc.

	-Swing component classes: JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JCheckBox, etc.

	-Swing components are enhanced versions of AWT components.
	
	-Swing components have more features (e.g., tooltips, icons, support for themes).

	-Naming convention in Swing is consistent with a "J" prefix.
3)Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications.
	-Both use the event delegation model.

	-Both use listeners like ActionListener, MouseListener, etc.

	-Swing supports more event types and listeners (e.g., ListSelectionListener, DocumentListener).

	-Swing enforces GUI updates on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).

	-Swing event-handling is generally safer and more robust in multithreaded environments.
